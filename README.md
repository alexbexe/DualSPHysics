# Instructions for regular users

If you only want a copy of DualSPHysics to make and run cases in your system, you probably want <a href="http://www.dual.sphysics.org/index.php/downloads/" target="_blank">the full DualSPHysics package</a> from the official webpage. There you will find documentation and a different set of packages for different versions of the application and different Operating Systems.

It is possible that you want the latest version in this repository that is not yet uploaded in the official web page. In this case check the [Building the project](#building-the-project) section to build an executable.

Have in mind that DualSPHysics needs a generated case to execute the SPH solver, so you want to check out GenCase too, included the main package on the <a href="http://www.dual.sphysics.org/index.php/downloads/" target="_blank">DualSPHysics webpage</a>.

# Instructions for developers
